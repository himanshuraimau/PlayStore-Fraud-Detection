# Architecture Overview

## System Design

The PlayStore Fraud Detection System follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐     ┌────────────┐
│ Data       │     │ Analysis   │     │ Output     │
│ Collection │ ──> │ Engine     │ ──> │ Generation │
└────────────┘     └────────────┘     └────────────┘
```

## Core Components

### PlayStoreFraudDetector

The central component orchestrating the entire fraud detection workflow. It manages:
- Coordinating data collection
- Preprocessing app data
- Sending data to LLM for analysis
- Validating and processing results

### PlayStoreClient

Responsible for fetching data from the Google Play Store, including:
- App details (title, description, price, etc.)
- Developer information
- User reviews
- Permission requirements

### LLM Integration

Leverages Google's Generative AI (Gemini) for intelligent analysis:
- Structured prompt engineering for consistent results
- Validation of output format
- Fallback mechanisms for error handling

### Data Flow

```
Google Play Store → PlayStoreClient → input.json → PlayStoreFraudDetector → LLM Analysis → analysis_results.json
```

## Key Design Principles

1. **Sequential Processing**: Clearly defined workflow steps with data persistence between each stage
2. **Error Resilience**: Robust error handling throughout the pipeline
3. **Configurability**: Customizable parameters for search queries, model selection, and analysis depth
4. **Modularity**: Components can be used independently or as part of the workflow

## Technical Implementation

The system is implemented in Python with the following technologies:

- **google-play-scraper**: For fetching app data from Google Play Store
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini)**: For intelligent analysis of app data
- **Logging System**: Comprehensive logging for traceability and debugging
- **JSON Data Format**: For structured data storage and transfer between components

## Processing Pipeline

1. **Initialization**: Setup logging, parse command line arguments, configure components
2. **Data Collection**: Scrape app data based on search query and save to input.json
3. **Preprocessing**: Extract and structure relevant features from raw app data
4. **Analysis**:
   - Generate structured prompts for LLM
   - Process each app with appropriate context
   - Validate and standardize results
5. **Output Generation**: Save structured results to analysis_results.json

## Extensibility Points

The architecture is designed to be extended in the following areas:

- **Additional data sources**: Extend beyond Google Play Store
- **Custom analyzers**: Add specialized analyzers for specific fraud patterns
- **Alternative ML models**: Support for different LLMs or traditional ML approaches
- **Integration points**: APIs for integration with other security systems
